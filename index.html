<h2> Introduction </h2>

    I was born in Munster Indiana but I currently live in Orland Park IL, which has a fun little 30 to 40 minute commute to Lewis everyday. 
    I am vice president of the E-Sports club here at Lewis and I have lots of fun getting people to interact with new technology.
    I am going to turn 20 this semester and I am very excited to make jokes about one day turning 30, but until then I am
    so happy to be in this weird place where I'm an adult and have to be responsible for myself but I'm still a child at the same time.
    I currently work at UPS, but unfortunetly suffered a permanent hand injury in both hands last May. I have many full-blood,
    half-blood, and step siblings. My dream is to one day as soon as possible have my own place to live.

<h4> My Favorite Hobby </h4>

 
    My favorite hobby would be reading. I find reading to be just as interesting as watching a show on Netflix or a movie. I binge books just as I binge tv shows.
    I find it so much fun to delve into a universe made by an author. I think this is a great way to have a peaceful headspace. Instead of worrring
    about life and my future I can think about the characters in a book all day. My favorite types of books are distopias. I find it is an amazing
    way to think about my career, as many distopias show the dissent or the assent of technology and how that effects the world and the people in it.
    I also find it inspirational for future projects I  might want to code in college.
